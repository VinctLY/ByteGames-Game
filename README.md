The [NextJS Framework](https://nextjs.org) is used to create this project. This purpose of this project is to showcase my other projects in the game development which I plan to develop using the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Although for the moment I am not very focused on such project for a personal reason.
